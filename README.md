**Open Banking App V01**

This is a very simple example of invoking Australia's Open Banking APIs.

It uses a published link of the major Australian Financial Institution's Open Banking API endpoints. Thanks to Luke Prior and his work on the Open Banking APIs, particularly his comprehensive list of the API endpoints.

The only API method that has been implemented to date is the **Products** method, which retrieves all of the Products from the Financial Institution. The user can specify the Page Number and Page Size of the call.
